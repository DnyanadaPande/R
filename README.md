R code examples.

Author: Dnyanada Pande

This repository contains examples of R code that have been used in post-processing analysis and to create graphs.

1. CircosPlot.R - This code takes the output from CircosInput.py and generates a dataframe of the integration sites classified into the genome bins based on the chromosome number and position.

2. Heatmap_clones.R - This code compares the presence/absence of clones in two control samples and visualizes that in the form of a heatmap.

3. StackedBarPlots.R - This code extracts and matches patterns from CIGAR strings and makes barplots of the frequencies.
